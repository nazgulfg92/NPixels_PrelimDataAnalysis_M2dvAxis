# NPixels_PrelimDataAnalysis_M2dvAxis

This is a simple analysis of concurrent Neuropixels and vocalization recordings. The files on which this is done are as follows:

M2-DVAxis-210922-210922-G1-T19.wav

for the wav.. and something like

M2-DVAxis-210922-210922_g9_t0.imec0.lf.bin

for the neuropixels recordings.

This is just for illustration and to make a point about neuropixels recordings in bats, in the full dorso-ventral axis of the brain. This wouldn't be published.
